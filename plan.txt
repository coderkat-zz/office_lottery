TO DO:

Set up login?? user control?

different setup for entry page:
	-after each entry added, redirect to the same page
	 and show a list of what has been added thus far.
	
	-include a "Ready??" button that directs to /show_setup page
	
	- /show_setup has a "need to make more changes?" "Go bacK" button that redirects to /the_lottery

	-Create the option to delete someting you added

----------

ideas for usability:

allow participants to indicate what games they'd like to be in the running for (using their "buy-in's")

table for each participant?
